******** IF CODE DOES NOT RUN IN VISUAL STUDIO ADD EXISTING MISSING FILES (NOT OUR FAULT) ********

When the program is first run the start screen is opened up, If the tests want to be seen, you must go into main.cpp and change testing = true, if this is done then when the program is run then the terminal will also open up.

Terminal: The terminal displays all of our tests, it gives a brief explanation of what should happen in each test, and what the results should be. 

Start Screen: The start screen can be navigated by using the arrow keys, press enter to select the option that is desired

Level Selector Screen: Once “play” has been selected the level selector screen will show up. This can be navigated by using the “a” and “d” keys, to enter a level the enter key can be pressed. Note that only the last level is actually completed/working, 

Battle: Once the enter key has been pressed you enter the battle mode with the opponent. The opponent comes into view and says their intro phrase. After pressing enter the player is greeted with their move selection menu. You can press 1-3 to choose what type of move to use, and then in the selected menu you can use the keys “z”, “x”, “C”, and “V” to choose a move to attack with. Moves of the same type cannot be used multiple times in a row. Once the move is selected the battle scene will start. Whoever’s move has a better speed stat as well as whoever has the higher agility stat will attack first. The enemy character picks their move at the same time that the player does automatically. 

Certain types do stronger damage to moves of other types. When a character uses a type, its damage is modified based on the type the last enemy used. 

Def strong against Strength
Strength strong against Agility
Agility strong against Defense

Vice versa for weaknesses.
